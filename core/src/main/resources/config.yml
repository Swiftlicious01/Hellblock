  # The default starting number for each of the following:
  # Protection range stands for the starting range in each direction (x, z) that players can build before being stopped.
  # Party size is the starting party count allowed per hellblock.
  # Hopper limit is the amount of hoppers allowed to work per hellblock before stopping any being placed/working further.
  # Generator chance is the additional chance added to the configured chance per generator block below a 10% defined in this file. 
  # Piglin bartering chance is the additonal chance added to the configured chance per piglin bartering item below a 5% defined in this file.
  # Crop growth rate will grow your crops faster (in combination when lava rain or next to lava already) by a defined percentage.
  # Mob spawn rate will increase the chance for mobs to spawn on your island by a defined percentage.
  # 0.0 starting means it will not add anything to the defined values.
  # When defining values per generator-chance, piglin-bartering, crop-growth or mob-spawn-rate it will not be a overall value 
  # but it just adds to the current so 0.2 for tier 1 will add to an already default value of say 0.5.

# You add the block material type and then the amount of levels you want it to add to the hellblock.
# Example: 'cobblestone:5' will add 5 levels to the hellblock when cobblestone is placed. Doesn't matter if a trusted member, party member or owner places it.
# Levels are done in a decimal system so it can be 0.5 to only add half a level as well.
# Blocks will add nothing to the island level unless it is displayed below in the list.
# If you wish to define a specific mob spawner type you can put the entity's name after like shown in the example below for it to only work for that entity type.
