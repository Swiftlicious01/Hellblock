  # The default starting number for each of the following:
  # Protection range stands for the starting range in each direction (x, z) that players can build before being stopped.
  # Party size is the starting party count allowed per hellblock.
  # Hopper limit is the amount of hoppers allowed to work per hellblock before stopping any being placed/working further.
  # Generator chance is the additional chance added to the configured chance per generator block below a 10% defined in this file. 
  # Piglin bartering chance is the additonal chance added to the configured chance per piglin bartering item below a 5% defined in this file.
  # Crop growth rate will grow your crops faster (in combination when lava rain or next to lava already) by a defined percentage.
  # Mob spawn rate will increase the chance for mobs to spawn on your island by a defined percentage.
  # 0.0 starting means it will not add anything to the defined values.
  # When defining values per generator-chance, piglin-bartering, crop-growth or mob-spawn-rate it will not be a overall value 
  # but it just adds to the current so 0.2 for tier 1 will add to an already default value of say 0.5.
  # Upgrade cost options are the following: MONEY (Vault support), POINTS (PlayerPoints support), ITEM (vanilla items) or EXP/XP/EXPERIENCE.
