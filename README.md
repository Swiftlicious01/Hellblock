# 🔥 Hellblock – The Ultimate Skyblock in the Nether 🔥

**Hellblock** is a feature-packed, Nether-themed twist on the classic Skyblock game mode. Instead of starting on a floating island in the overworld, players are dropped into the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the **Nether** — with nothing but their wits, lava, and a whole new set of challenges and tools to survive and thrive.

Built with extensibility, performance, and fun in mind, Hellblock includes **custom mechanics**, **beautiful animations**, and an immersive experience designed for players who crave something new and devilishly difficult.
